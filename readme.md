This program is designed to help you keep track of your options trades.
Features currently being offered include:
  - Open position tracking
  - Daily, weekly, and monthly progress tracking
  - Portfolio graph visualizing the end value of your portfolio for the previous five trading days
  - Logging of all trades for use in keeping a trading journal
  - Easy-to-use UI
I encourage you to utilize this program to help manage your portfolio and open trades.
Things to note:
  - Every time you use the exit button in the top-left of the program, it records your current portfolio value as that day's ending portfolio value, so, if you open the program during a trading day, minimize it until you are finished trading, or if you open it during a non-trading day, close it out from the taskbar/toolbar to prevent the portfolio value from being recorded
  - Daily, weekly, and monthly goals are currently hard-set at 25, 90, and 300, and cannot be changed, I will add the ability to customize them in the future
